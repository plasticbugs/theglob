# First flash: what to do and what to read

For the person holding the Pocket. Keep this exact — it is read from while
someone decodes squares off a screen.

## Before flashing

- `sim/lint.sh` clean; `sim/run_mem.sh` passes at `-gap 8 -hold 4`.
- The whole-machine bench on the real memory glue boots.
- **`tools/check_frames.py` passes on three CONSECUTIVE frames of a STILL
  picture** — snapshot the boot screen at, say, 2500, 2520 and 2540 ms and run
  it on the three. If neighbours differ while frames two apart are identical,
  the core is emitting alternating fields. The Pocket's panel is OLED and
  holds the difference between the two images — as retention that fades, and
  with enough hours as wear that does not. A core shipped this way and left a
  ghost on a user's screen; nothing else on this list touches their hardware.
  Do not flash until it passes (METHODOLOGY 5.23).
- `tools/check_json.py pkg/pocket --active <W>x<H>` clean — the firmware
  refuses a bad `interact.json` with nothing but "General Error", and a
  `video.json` that disagrees with the core comes out as three separate-looking
  picture faults.
- `./build-local.sh compile`: no negative slack in any corner
  (`projects/output_files/*.sta.summary`), no ignored constraints.
- The ROM image's md5 matches the MRA's.

## On the card

`release/pocket/` onto the card root, with `cp -X` from macOS. The ROM image
goes in `Assets/mycore/common/mycore.rom`. Verify the bitstream's md5 on the
card.

## The skeleton, before there is a game

A white crosshatch every 16 pixels with red, green and blue bars across the
middle, dark above bright. A cyan square moves with the d-pad, turns yellow on
button 1 (A or Y) and magenta on button 2 (B or X); button 1 also beeps. Every
grid cell the same size and every line unbroken means the raster, the video
hand-over, the scaler settings, the controls and the audio path all work.

## The panel

Menu → **Bring-up: panel**. Four rows of 32 squares along the bottom edge of
the picture (the *right* edge if the picture is rotated 270, read bottom to
top). Green is 1. Read each row from the end where row 0 shows `1010 1010`.

| row | squares | meaning | healthy |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1–8 | alignment marker | `1010 1010` — if not, stop: the reading is misaligned |
| 0 | 9–16 | frame counter | changing |
| 0 | 17 | PLL locked | 1 |
| 0 | 18 | memory ready | 1 |
| 0 | 19 | downloading | 0 |
| 0 | 20 | all slots complete | 1 |
| 0 | 21 | loaded | 1 |
| 0 | 22 | core in reset | 0 |
| 0 | 23 | CPU halted | 0 |
| 0 | 24 | watchdog has fired | 0 (expected 1 after the menu has been open a while) |
| 0 | 25–32 | system inputs, active low | `1111 1111` with nothing pressed |
| 1 | 1–8, 9–32 | first fault: vector, then the code address before it | all 0 |
| 2 | 1–16, 17–24, 25–32 | first program ROM word, first sound ROM byte, first graphics byte | *fill in from the image* |
| 3 | 1–16, 17–32 | SRAM self-test | `1010 0101 0101 1010`, `0101 1010 1010 0101` |

Row 2 proves the path, not the image; `sim/run_mem.sh` proves the image.

## If it is wrong

| symptom | look at |
|---|---|
| black, counter running, row 2 right, watchdog 1 | the image in SDRAM — rerun `sim/run_mem.sh`; section 5.16 |
| row 3 not the pattern | **Bring-up: SRAM** switches; then the SRAM port |
| row 2 wrong | **Bring-up: SDRAM** switches; then the PLL phase (SDC, section 5.20) |
| garbled picture | ask for the service-mode test pattern first; section 5.18 |
| glitches only while playing, gone in the menu | something the CPU shares with the video; section 5.17 |
| menu restarts the game | `pause` has reached a reset; section 5.5 |

## Log

Date, build md5, what was seen, what it ruled out. One line each. The theories
that died belong here as much as the one that lived.
