#
# Takes the bitstream from that run rather than recompiling, so the release
# ships the exact gateware that was tested on hardware. Everything outside the
# bitstream (JSON definitions, platform image, ROM recipe, README) comes from
# the working tree, which is how a definition-only change can be released
# without a rebuild.
#
# Creating the tag triggers the Compile Core workflow; it sees the release
# already exists and skips publishing, leaving this artifact in place.
