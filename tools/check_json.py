"""Check the core's JSON against what the Pocket's firmware will accept.

    tools/check_json.py [pkg/pocket]

The APF parses these files itself and says almost nothing when it cannot:
the first flash of this core stopped at `Load error in "interact" - General
Error`, which was a duplicate variable id (two entries had used id 20) and
two names longer than the field allows.  Nothing in the build caught it,
because everything in the build only ever read the files with a JSON parser,
which is not what the firmware does.

So this checks the things the firmware cares about and a parser does not:

  * every file is valid JSON and carries the magic the firmware looks for;
  * interact variable ids are unique -- the fault above;
  * a list's `defaultval` is an INDEX into its options, not the value to
    write -- which is what the second flash died on, with indices of 256,
    16384 and 2097152 into lists of sixteen.  Every core that loads uses
    0 to 3 there, and in each one it selects the option whose value is
    zero;
  * names fit, and a list's options each have a name and a value;
  * data slot ids are unique and required slots name a filename;
  * video.json's scaler modes declare the size the core actually emits,
    given as --active WxH (the boot bench prints it).  This one is
    not a firmware rule, it is the fault it catches: the template shipped
    320x224 from an arcade board while this core emits 640x256, and on
    hardware that came out as a picture squished horizontally, the bottom
    32 lines -- where the on-screen keyboard is drawn -- cut off, and the
    whole image flickering;
  * the files are no larger than the largest this firmware is known to
    accept, because size is the one limit that cannot be read off the file.

It exits non-zero and prints every fault, not just the first.
