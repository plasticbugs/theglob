# My Core on the Pocket: timing constraints beyond the BSP's
# sys_constr.sdc. The 96 MHz system clock, its 6.857 MHz video pair and the
# shifted SDRAM clock all come from core_pll and are timed as one related
# group; the two 74.25 MHz inputs and the audio PLL are asynchronous to it.
# The PLL's fifth output drives nothing in core_top, so no clock of its own
# reaches the netlist and it is not named here -- naming it only bought an
# ignored-filter warning that hid the ones that mattered.

# SDRAM: the chip is clocked by the phase-shifted PLL output (core_pll's
# outclk_3).  The shift divides the budget between two checks that pull
# opposite ways: the data the chip returns is captured by an I/O-cell register
# on the core clock, and the address and command the core drives are captured
# by the chip.  On the captured data, setup gets 2T - shift and hold gets
# T - shift, so a nanosecond off the shift is a nanosecond onto setup and a
# nanosecond off hold.
#
# THE SHIFT IS PER-DESIGN.  5.859 ns is where Master of Weapon's fit balanced
# (setup slack = 6.241 - shift at slow 85C, hold slack = shift - 5.519 at fast
# 0C); the board is the same for every core but the fit is not.  If the worst
# path in a build is dram_dq[*] -> sdram_ctrl|dq_in[*], measure both slacks at
# two shift values, solve for where they meet, and round to a multiple of
# 130.2 ps, the step the 960 MHz VCO can make.  projects/report_worst.tcl
# writes the reports to read: worst_paths*.txt for setup, worst_hold_fast.txt
# for hold.  METHODOLOGY.md section 5.20.

# Multicycle exceptions for clock-enabled blocks go here.  None are claimed
# yet, because the skeleton has nothing that needs one.  Before adding any,
# read METHODOLOGY.md sections 5.11 and 5.20:
#
#   * write down why EVERYTHING the filter matches qualifies, and register
#     every input at the edge of the relaxed region;
#   * a register Quartus merges into a block RAM's output no longer exists by
#     name, the filter matches nothing, and the line is ignored with a warning
#     -- CI fails the build on that (Check every constraint was applied);
#   * a block RAM read closes on one clock.  Leave it alone.
#
# The shape the sibling cores use, proven on hardware, for a CPU that steps on
# clock enables four or more system clocks apart:
#
#   set M68K [get_keepers {*|fx68k:*|*}]
#   set_multicycle_path -setup 4 -from $M68K -to $M68K
